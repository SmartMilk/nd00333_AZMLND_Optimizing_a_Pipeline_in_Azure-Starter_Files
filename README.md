# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
This dataset contains data from the UCI repository "Bank Marketing Data Set" (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing) which contains data from a Portugeuse banking institution and predicts on whether a client will subscribe a term deposit to their bank using 20 attributes such as age, employment variation rate, and days of the week the client was contacted. 

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**
The best performing model 

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
